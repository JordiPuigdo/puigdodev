The project involved the complete development of a digital system consisting of a corporate website, an appointment scheduling tool for managing medical availability, and an internal sales application (Dashboard). This application manages appointments, automated WhatsApp messages and client notifications, and integrates with the external Flowww system to optimize calendars, treatments and resources. As a Fullstack Developer, I participated in the system architecture, frontend development with Next.js and Tailwind CSS, and backend with .NET. One of the main technical challenges was scaling the system and building a custom gateway to add specific functionalities not provided by the third-party system, especially for treatments with particular requirements. The project was developed by a team with strong focus on efficiency and continuous improvement of the clinics' internal processes.",
